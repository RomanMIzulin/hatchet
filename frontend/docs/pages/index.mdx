# Introduction

Welcome to Hatchet! Hatchet is a workflow engine and event storage API, designed to make it easy to build distributed applications. The project has the following high-level goals:

1. **Serve application developers:** we aim to support a broad set of languages and frameworks, to make it easier to support your existing applications. We currently support a Typescript and Go SDK, with more languages coming soon.
2. **Simple to setup:** we've seen too many overengineered stacks built on a fragile task queue with overly complex infrastructure. Hatchet is designed to be simple to setup, with a single command to get started.
3. **Flexibility when you need it:** as your application grows, you can use Hatchet to support complex, multi-step distributed workflows. Hatchet's backend is modular, allowing for customizing the implementation of the event storage API, queueing system, authentication, and more.

We currently support the following features, with many more on the roadmap:

- **Event storage API:** store events in a durable event log, with support for querying and filtering events:

- **Workflow engine:** define workflows which run when events occur, with support for retries, timeouts, and parallelism:

- **Web platform for visilibility and monitoring**: view the status of your workflows, and drill down into individual events:
