# Syntax

## Input types

`with:` blocks can be used to specify input types. Data can be set statically or dynamically following Go templating syntax. The following example shows how to set a static value:

```yaml
with:
  static: "value"
```

The following example shows how to set a dynamic value:

```yaml
with:
  dynamic: "{{ .steps.stepOne.message }}"
```

If the `stepOne` step has an output value of `message`, the value of `dynamic` will be set to the value of `message` from `stepOne`.

### Passing Events as Inputs

It's common to pass the event payload as inputs to a step. This can be done by using the `event` field together with the reserved `object`. Let's say the event payload is the following JSON:

```json
{
  "message": "hello world"
}
```

You can then pass the entire object to `stepOne` using the following syntax:

```yaml
with:
  object: "{{ .event.json }}"
```

### Passing Outputs as Inputs

It's common to pass the output of one step as the input to another step. This can be done by using the `json` field together with the reserved `object`. Let's say the output of `stepOne` is the following JSON:

```json
{
  "message": "hello world"
}
```

You can then pass the entire object to `stepTwo` using the following syntax:

```yaml
with:
  object: "{{ .steps.stepOne.json }}"
```
